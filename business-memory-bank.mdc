AI Agent Memory Management Rules (Business Context)

This document contains the core rules that an AI agent should
follow when interacting with the file system to manage its business memory.

The goal of these rules is to ensure the consistency,
completeness, and relevance of information for planning, analysis,
problem-solving, and idea generation tasks within multiple
interconnected businesses and projects.

## General Principles

* **Action Confirmation:** Before executing any action that could lead to
  significant changes or deletion of information, always request explicit
  confirmation from the user.
* **Data Integrity:** Always strive to maintain data integrity and coherence.
  Avoid duplication where it is not justified.
* **Alignment with Goals:** Any new ideas or proposed solutions must be consistent
  with the data in the mission-and-goals.md files at the corresponding level
  (business or project), as well as with business.md at the business level.
* **Proactive Memory Management:** The agent should not only record information
  but also proactively maintain the memory structure, its relevance,
  and effectiveness for quick searching and retrieval of relevant data.
* **Single Source of Truth:** Each fact should be stored in only one place
* **References Instead of Copying:** Use references to other files instead of duplicating information
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Before creating new files, check for existing content to avoid duplication
* **Facts Only:** The memory bank stores only factual information, not planning tasks or ideation
* **Date Accuracy:** When recording dates in progress logs, ALWAYS use the `date` shell command
  - NEVER hallucinate, guess, or use assumed dates
  - Always get the actual current date from the system

## 1. Core File Reading

**Trigger:** At the start of each new dialogue or interaction with the user.

**Action Rule:** The agent must read the following core files relevant
to the current active business and project context to ensure
foundational understanding and immediate relevance:
- business.md (consolidated business overview and plan)
- progress-log.md

Additionally, the agent should review project-level files for the current project to stay updated
on ongoing activities and recent developments.

## 2. Memory System Initialization

**Trigger:** The user requests: "Initialize memory system." or "Start a new business project."
or if no memory bank has been found.

**Action Rules:**
* **Clarification Request:** If the request concerns a new business or project, the agent should clarify:
  "For which business (e.g., 'Acme Corp', 'Startup Innovations') or project (e.g., 'New Product Launch X',
  'Process Optimization') do you want to initialize memory?"
* **Current Context Definition:** After initialization or the first mention of a business/project,
  the agent should consider it the current active context, unless the user explicitly specifies another.
* **Existence Check:** Before creating, check if the following directories and files already exist
  for the specified business/project.
* **Structure Creation:** Create the following directory hierarchy and initial Markdown files.
  Each business and project will have its nested structure:

```
/memory-bank/
└── BusinessName1/ (e.g., Acme Corp)
    ├── business.md (Consolidated business overview, mission, goals, partnerships, risks)
    ├── progress-log.md (Log of completed tasks and decisions)
    ├── project-artifacts/ (Directory for factual documents and completed artifacts)
    └── ProjectName1.1/ (e.g., New Product Launch X)
        ├── mission-and-goals.md (Mission, goals and detailed project description)
        ├── progress-log.md (Log of completed tasks and decisions)
        └── project-artifacts/ (Directory for factual documents and completed artifacts)
```

**Initial Information Request:**
If business.md (at the business level) or mission-and-goals.md (at the project level) is empty after initialization,
politely ask the user for basic information to populate it. The mission-and-goals.md file should contain comprehensive
project information including goals, technical specifications, infrastructure details, and investment proposals.

## 3. Information Update

**Trigger:** The user provides new information or requests: "Add this information."

**Action Rules:**

### Automatic Target Determination
The agent must analyze the content of the new information and its context (including
the current active business/project or mentions in the text) to automatically determine
the most suitable file or section for recording.

**Determination Priorities (descending order):**
1. **Explicit Mention:** If the user explicitly specifies a business ("For Project X of Acme Corp...")
   or a project, the agent must use that context.
2. **Current Session Context:** If there's no explicit mention, the agent must use the last
   actively discussed business/project.

### Semantic Content Analysis
- **Completed actions/decisions:** Record in `CurrentBusiness/CurrentProject/progress-log.md`
- **Project-specific goals and detailed descriptions:** Record in `CurrentBusiness/CurrentProject/mission-and-goals.md`
- **General business goals/strategy:** Record in `CurrentBusiness/business.md`
- **Overall business strategy:** Record in `CurrentBusiness/business.md`
- **Completed documents/artifacts:** Store in `CurrentBusiness/CurrentProject/project-artifacts/`

**Clarification:** If the agent cannot unambiguously determine the appropriate business/project or file,
it should politely clarify with the user where to best record the information,
offering 1-2 most likely options.

### Update Type
- **For progress-log.md:** Always append a new entry with current date and brief description
  - **CRITICAL:** Use the `date` shell command to get the actual current date
  - **NEVER hallucinate or guess the date** - always use the shell command
- **For all other files:** Intelligent merge/replace, integrating new information logically

### Format and Confirmation
- **Format Preservation:** Strive to preserve the original Markdown file format
- **Confirmation for Significant Changes:** Request confirmation if update significantly alters key aspects
- **Brief Confirmation:** Confirm where information was added after successful recording

## 4. Progress Log Format Standards

**Purpose:** Progress logs serve as factual records of completed actions and decisions that provide context for current business state, track completed work, and optimize LLM context usage.

### Optimal Log Format Structure
```
# Progress Log - [Project Name]

## [Date]
- [Action]: [Key details]
- [Action]: [Key details]

## [Date]
- [Action]: [Key details]

## Key Dates (if applicable)
- [Date]: [Event]
```

### Format Rules
- **Chronological Order:** Newest entries first for quick scanning
- **Action-Focused:** "What was done" not "what will be done"
- **Minimal Context:** Essential details only, no explanations
- **Consistent Format:** Same structure across all projects
- **Factual Only:** Completed actions, decisions, and outcomes
- **No Checkmarks:** Avoid visual clutter (no ✅ symbols)
- **No Bold Formatting:** Keep it simple and clean
- **No Explanations:** Just facts, no reasoning
- **No Future Plans:** Only completed actions
- **No Redundant Information:** Avoid repeating data from other files

### Content Guidelines
- **Use concise language** - one line per action when possible
- **Include key metrics** when actions involve numerical changes
- **Reference external files** for detailed information

## 5. Memory Reorganization and Optimization

**Trigger:** When information accumulates in files, files exceed reasonable sizes, or after significant changes.

**Action Rules:**

### Automatic Necessity Determination
Indicators for reorganization:
- Unrelated topics within single file (low semantic coherence)
- Opportunity for better logical organization
- Information belonging to different projects/businesses
- Reduced search efficiency due to large volumes

### Types of Reorganization
- **File/Directory Movement:** Creating new directories or moving files between existing ones
- **Content Restructuring:** Modifying internal structure for better readability
- **Consolidation:** Merging small related files into one
- **Duplicate/Outdated Information Removal:** Removing temporary files and duplicate content
- **Content Consolidation:** Merging detailed project descriptions into mission-and-goals.md files

### File Size and Content Rules
- **All files:** Remove redundant information and consolidate similar content
- **Details vs References:** Store details in appropriate files, use references in logs

### Notification and Confirmation
- **Minor reorganizations:** Agent can act autonomously
- **Significant changes:** Notify user and request confirmation before execution
- **Link Verification:** Check and update internal links after reorganization

### Reading Priorities
1. Read business.md for context
2. Check progress-log.md for recent activities
3. Use references for navigation between files
4. Access detailed artifacts only when needed

## 6. Dialog-Driven Rule Generation

**Trigger:** User explains processes, states preferences, or demonstrates workflows in conversation

**Action Rules:**

### Rule Extraction
- **Extract:** Actionable rules, procedures, workflows, preferences, decision criteria from dialog patterns
- **Identify:** Clear, actionable patterns that can be codified as rules
- **Focus:** On specific, repeatable processes and preferences rather than general business knowledge

### Dynamic Rule Creation
Create `.mdc` files in `/memory-bank/.cursor/rules/` as needed:
- **Agent Autonomy:** Agent determines appropriate file names based on rule type and context
- **File Organization:** Create separate files for distinct rule domains as conversation reveals patterns
- **Flexible Structure:** Organize by functional area, process type, or preference category as appropriate
- **Granularity Control:** Agent decides whether to create single comprehensive files or multiple focused files

### File Format Requirements
Each `.mdc` file must include proper Cursor metadata:
```
---
description: "[Brief description of learned rules]"
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### Content Structure
- **Clear Rules:** Concise, actionable rules derived from user dialog patterns
- **Process Focus:** Specific workflows, procedures, and decision criteria
- **Preference Capture:** User preferences for tools, approaches, and communication styles
- **Workflow Patterns:** Recurring processes and their optimal execution paths

### Validation and Confirmation
- **Confirm Significant Changes:** Confirm significant rule additions/changes with user before creating/updating `.mdc` files
- **User Review:** Present proposed rules for user approval when creating new rule files
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allow user to modify and refine generated rules

### Application and Integration
- **Automatic Application:** Generated rules automatically apply via Cursor's rule system
- **Seamless Integration:** Rules integrate with existing Cursor IDE functionality
- **Context Awareness:** Rules apply appropriately based on file types and project contexts

### Rule Management
- **Dynamic Creation:** Create, update, merge, or split rule files as dialog patterns evolve
- **Version Control:** Maintain rule history and allow rollback to previous versions
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle rule conflicts by prioritizing user preferences and recent patterns

### Maintenance and Optimization
- **Continuous Refinement:** Continuously refine rule organization based on conversation insights
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track rule effectiveness and user satisfaction
- **Rule Consolidation:** Merge related rules and remove outdated patterns as needed
- **User Feedback Integration:** Incorporate user feedback to improve rule accuracy and relevance

**Note:** Agent has full autonomy over file naming, organization, and granularity. Keep rules minimal and action-focused, avoiding duplication of existing business knowledge content.
